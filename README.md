## Description

- What was your motivation? This project was very challenge and difficult because the CSS Code wasn't easy to understand, but I study a lot so I learn and practice how to modify HTML, CSS and improve the quality for website 
- Why did you build this project? I build this project for showing my work experience and background in Computer Science so it will be easy for company to know me closely and show my work.
- What problem does it solve?
1- I solved many problems like: I split the webpage to many sections and locate each section in the right location
2- I used semantic HTML elements
3- I add menu and my name in the header, the menu has four items "about me, Work, Contact Me, resume", each one I connect to the part belong to it   
4- in the work section I add five images with special design using grid-elements-area on CSS code, each image has mouse hover and I link it to the about me section area, one of the image has bigger size than other. 
5- I fix the CSS code inside my webpage if the screen size was under 768px so it can work with small screen

- What did you learn? I learn a lot about HTML and CSS attribute and how to do many things for margin ,boarding, padding, CSS selectors, grid-elements and HTML tags,
